/* Here, you'll use your knowledge of the DOM to create HTML elements 
for each hero from the 'database' as well as assign event handlers.

This step requires the 2 other parts ("heroes.js" and "methods.js")
to be functional. However, you can still work on the HTML and CSS
of the site as well as setting up the event handlers.

1) In "index.html", create an empty `div` with an id of "gridDiv"

2) create a variable "gridDiv" in this file and use the DOM to store the reference of the div you
just made into it.
*/

/* 3) call the method "heroCreator.populateGrid()" and provide it with
2 arguments, the "gridDiv" variable you just made, and the "heroes"
array variable.
NOTE: the method and the array are defined in the other .js
files. If those parts are working correctly, there shouldn't be
an error. */

/* 4) In "style.css", add styling to the `#gridDiv`.
    Make sure to add a margin of 3%;
*/

/* 5)* Setup the CSS for all the hero boxes in "style.css", which should all be divs with
        a class of ".hero_container"
    * Within this CSS selector, add these styles:
        * display as flex and as rows
        * a background-color of #f7931e 
        * a border of "1px solid #00aeff"
        * a padding of 1%
        * a margin 3%
*/

/* 6)* Setup the CSS for all the textboxes for each hero in "style.css", which should all be divs with
        a class of ".hero_text"
    * Within this CSS selector, add these styles:
        * display as flex and as columns
        * a padding of 2%
*/


// Add line from heroes.js here

/* BONUS: Add more styles to make the hero containers look nicer! */
